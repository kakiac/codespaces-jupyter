Brilliant care,Diabetic Medicine,"July 19, 2023",5,The care provided by the hospital for my child who has type 1 diabetes is excellent. They are so supportive and the consultant deals with and supports the school.  We have access to an email address that is repsonded to quickly and we can contact them  24hrs a day.
I was treated very well,Endoscopy,"July 18, 2023",5,"I was booked in for a colonoscopy. Before I attended I had a zoom meeting with the staff nurse, I found her to be very good and alayed any fear or questions I had, it was very conveinient on zoom. When I arrived at the hospital clinic I only had to wait a few minutes before I was met by a friendly staff member and took me through. The procedure went well and they treated me very well. I also had a follow up call from the hospital a few days after the procedure, I was very impressed with them."
Appreciation of care at breast screening,Imaging,"July 15, 2023",5,I have an unusual disability of severe light sensitivity and was apprehensive about having a mammogram on July 12th. It was a great relief to find that the room lighting was already dimmed when I arrived and I had minimal exposure to lighting and I greatly appreciated the thoughtful and caring approach of the radiographer during my appointment.
My medication wasn't locked away,wards,"July 12, 2023",4,"I went in to have an operation on my parathyroid. On the ward usually patients individual medication prescribed would be locked in their own cabinet. I discovered that my cabinet was left unlocked with my medication inside. It was concerning really, it made me think that it was a good job that I was clearly thinking as it could have been unsafe. I did mention it at the time and they did realise that they had made a mistake."
Please look at people with hearing loss,Ear Nose and Throat,"July 12, 2023",3,"I have found that consultatnts in the ENT department do need to remember to look at patients when they are talking and not at their computer screen, We reply on being able to see peoples lips,  it is a really difficult for the patient when you cannot see the lips. I am a little older and will say but someone who is younger may not feel that they have the confidence to mention it."
A very good treatment for colonoscopy.,unknown,"July 10, 2023",5,"I went to Ipswich Hospital for colonoscopy this morning and was very happy with the treatment that I received. 
I want to thank all the staff for the treatment that I received this morning. Keep up the good work."
Cancer treatment great,Cancer services,"July 10, 2023",5,I recently finished my chemo and ratdiotherapy and the staff have been great. They have time to listen and speak to you as an individual and provided amazing care. I didn't have to wait long for the referral in the first place either so I've been very pleased with everything
Hip replacement criteria is strict,Orthopaedics,"July 5, 2023",1,I needed a hip replacement but was told that I couldn't have the operation until I lost 20lbs. My hip was so bad that I could hardly walk but I managed to lose 16.5lbs before having a fall and further injuring it. They still wouldn't consider doing the hip surgery even though I was unable to be active at all and would've struggled to lose the last few pounds. In the end I had to make the difficult decision to go private and have since managed to lose more weight as a result of being more active.  I even saw the same consultant as I would've on the NHS and my weight wasn't an issue.  I feel that there needs to be some flexibility in the system to take other issues in to account.
Amazing cancer care,Cancer services,"July 5, 2023",5,"Cancer treatment and care from the first time I visited for scans and tests all the way through to my treatment finishing a month a go had all been very good. I've received amazing support, advice and care from staff and really can't fault anything."
Lack of physiotherapy,Physiotherapy,"July 5, 2023",3,Care received at the hospital when I had back surgery last year was good but I was discharged with out any access to physiotherapy afterwards. I was receiving physio for other issues but staff there were unable to get me back in to the system for support.

Always seen quickly,Eye Clinic,"June 28, 2023",4,"We have found the acute eye clinic to be excellent. If you need to see someone quickly they have always been able to see me the same day or the next day at the latest. I have found the consultant for glaucoma to be good medically but his attitude is poor, if I have questions to ask he becomes very abrupt and clearly does not like questions being asked, he has a strong accent and this also makes it most difficult to understand him, so communication on the whole could be much better and attitude a lot kinder."
Staff were brilliant,Gastrointestinal and Liver services,"June 27, 2023",5,"I have a colonoscopy every 3 years, they keep tabs on me as I had polyps removed. Staff are brilliant and very caring. They prepare me well but the medication you have to take before the procedure is disgusting flavour. It has never been a painful procedure, its better now that they go in just once to retrieve the polyp rather than the way they used to do it going in again after cutting it. The aftercare is excellent and they make me wait and give me a cup of tea before I leave."
Good staff but not enough of them,Accident and emergency services,"June 27, 2023",4,I broke my arm a few months ago and was waiting for the ambulance for two hours but when they came it was a relief. Once I got to the hospital I was in excruciating pain and the system in place meant that I ended up on a bed. I called for assistance as I needed the toilet but care did not come for about an hour and I ended up with a wet bed. At a later point I got myself up somehow and was told that I should not be up. I have to say that the staff were so lovely and caring but very under staffed and under pressure it seemed.
Good communication,Paediatrics/children services,"June 27, 2023",5,"My comments are in relation to paediatrics care and support within A & E, Bergholt and Boxford wards. We went in the ambulance to the hospital (the ambulance staff were superb) Their communication to me as foster mother was excellent and communication with me was seamless and were able to keep me updated very well. General care was very good and the staff all superb."
I was seen quickly,Oncology,"June 27, 2023",5,"I have given Ipswich hospital oncology 5 stars as I was referred for a growth on my nose and I was seen by the hospital very quickly, no complaints, I was pleased with how they dealt with me they were kind and professional."
Excellent service,Other,"June 27, 2023",5,"I have been to the hospital for various reasons and I have always found the hospital generally to be an excellent service to me, staff have been kind and courteous ever time and when you have been bereaved like me, it matters that people are kind."
Attentive staff,Accident and emergency services,"June 27, 2023",5,"I had a fall and went to A & E and they gave me a scan. I observed that staff were always doing something they were very busy. I felt that they were thorough with me and I felt that they checked me well. I felt well looked after and the staff were attentive, infact the staff were very good. I was seen within 2 hours which I thought was excellent."
They are thorough,Eye Clinic,"June 26, 2023",5,I have treatment every month with injections every 9 weekly for degeneration. My left eye has responded well to treatment which is encouraging. I find the staff to be polite and kind with me. They are thorough and check me well.
Very Good,Accident and emergency services,"June 26, 2023",5,"I was triaged within 30 mins, given pain killers sent to Xray, saw doctor and then sent home in a sling, was all done within 2 hours. and an appointment set up with the fracture clinic for me to return the next day. Staff attituide I found to be nice. Even had a follow up phone call from the fragility team, it felt very thorough. Very good."
I felt dismissed,Accident and emergency services,"June 26, 2023",2,"I was taken by an ambulance after having a car crash I waited in A & E for nine hours. I asked for more pain relief and I had to wait for over an hour before it came. They didnt even X Ray me which I thought would be matter of course. The moment that I mentioned that I had fibromyalgia I felt dismissed, I was disappointed with them."
