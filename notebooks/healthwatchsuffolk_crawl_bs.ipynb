    "#    class_=\"service-review-rating star-rating-compact\". Whilst when inspecting \n",
    "#    the element we could see the div, the scraper was reporting back as always \n",
    "#    getting a null. After several attempts, I had a look at the html in more \n",
    "#    detail, it seems that this was originally dynamically populated using a \n",
    "#    JQuery and Javascript. So instead, I aimed for the \"script\" tag, which \n",
    "#    the scraper seemed to have access to and which seemed to return something.\n",
    "#\n",
    "\n",
    "# see #1 in code. As it was not possible to read the div, as this was a JS \n",
    "#   dynamically created component (ie upon load), and the web crawler \n",
    "#   (BeautifulSoup) was not able to read it when running.\n",
    "# Solution: we read the script tag instead, to allow us in, as it had the score \n",
    "#   information needed\n",
    "\n",
    "# At this stage, I ended with a long JQuery text in the Ratings field, and here\n",
    "#   is when all the trouble of converting this to string and extracting the\n",
    "#   number started. \n",
    "#\n",
    "#   This looked like this:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   \n",
    "#   jQuery(window).load(function () {\n",
    "#        jQuery('#service-review-rating-214576').raty({\n",
    "#            readOnly: true,\n",
    "#            score: 5\n",
    "#        });\n",
    "#    });\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The next step was to try and somehow strip the text of everything before\n",
    "#    and after 5 (the rating) and store this as a string value in the ratings()\n",
    "#    method.\n",
    "# Eventually and after trying different ways to tackle this, I\n",
    "#    ended up with the solution below:\n",
    "\n",
    "# see in code #2. the contents of the \"script\" JS script need to be parsed \n",
    "#    using the BS decode_contents() method with a formatter=\"minimal\" parameter \n",
    "#    or formatter=\"html\". This will change the format of the <script> tag\n",
    "#    contents from type 'bytestream' to 'string', which will allow us to do \n",
    "#    further splitting and replacing. The formatter parameter will ensure that \n",
    "#    this conversion to string takes place.\n",
    "#    \n",
    "# Next, we need to split the long JQuery text. One way to do this is to use \n",
    "#    the partition() method.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# see in code #3. This will look for the string \"score: \" in the score_rating\n",
